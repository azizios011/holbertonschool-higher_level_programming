# Python - Test-driven development

This project focuses on practicing test-driven development (TDD) principles using Python. The goal is to enhance your understanding of Python programming, the importance of tests, and how to write documentation and tests using docstrings.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will be able to:

- Explain the advantages of Python programming.
- Understand the concept of interactive tests.
- Recognize the significance of tests in software development.
- Write docstrings to create tests.
- Write documentation for each module and function.
- Familiarize yourself with basic option flags to create tests.
- Identify and handle edge cases effectively.

## Requirements

### Python Scripts

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs.
- All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.8.5.
- All files should end with a new line.
- The first line of each file should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
- A README.md file, at the root of the project folder, is mandatory.
- Code should follow the pycodestyle (version 2.7.*) guidelines.
- All files must be executable.
- The length of the files will be tested using `wc`.

### Python Test Cases

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs.
- All files should end with a new line.
- All test files should be placed inside a folder named "tests".
- Test files should have the extension `.txt`.
- Tests should be executed using the command: `python3 -m doctest ./tests/*`.
- All modules should have proper documentation accessible using the command `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`.
- All functions should have proper documentation accessible using the command `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'`.
- The length of the documentation will be verified.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository_url>`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd <project_directory>`
3. Run the test cases: `python3 -m doctest ./tests/*`
4. Review the results and ensure that all tests pass.
5. Start implementing the necessary code in the Python scripts.
6. Follow the TDD approach by writing tests first and then implementing the corresponding code.
7. Keep running the test cases throughout the development process to verify the correctness of your code.
8. Document your modules and functions using appropriate docstrings.
9. Ensure that your code adheres to the pycodestyle guidelines.
10. Test your code thoroughly, considering edge cases and different input scenarios.
11. Submit your completed project for evaluation.
