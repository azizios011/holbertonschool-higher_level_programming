# Python Project: If/Else, Loops, Functions

This Python project demonstrates the usage of if/else statements, loops, and functions in Python programming. It includes various examples to help you understand and practice these fundamental concepts.

## Prerequisites

To run this project, you need the following:

- Python (version 3.5 or above) installed on your machine.

## Getting Started

Follow the instructions below to get started with the project:

1. Clone the repository or download the source code files.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

3. Run the Python script using the following command:

   ```
   python main.py
   ```

## Project Structure

The project contains the following files:

- `main.py`: The main Python script that contains examples of if/else statements, loops, and functions.

## Examples

The `main.py` script includes various examples that demonstrate the usage of if/else statements, loops, and functions. Here's a brief overview of the examples:

### If/Else Statements

- **Example 1:** Check if a number is positive, negative, or zero.
- **Example 2:** Determine if a year is a leap year or not.

### Loops

- **Example 3:** Print numbers from 1 to 10 using a `for` loop.
- **Example 4:** Calculate the factorial of a number using a `while` loop.

### Functions

- **Example 5:** Calculate the area of a circle using a function.
- **Example 6:** Generate a Fibonacci sequence using a recursive function.

Feel free to modify the code and experiment with different inputs to understand how these concepts work in Python.
