# Python - Hello, World

This repository contains solutions to the Python - Hello, World project. It consists of several Python scripts that demonstrate various concepts in Python programming.

## Concepts

- Python programming

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, make sure you have the following requirements:

- Python 3.8.5 or higher
- pycodestyle 2.7.* (for code style checking)

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

```
├── 0x00/
│   ├── 2-print.py
│   ├── 3-print_number.py
│   ├── 4-print_float.py
│   ├── 5-print_string.py
│   ├── 6-concat.py
│   ├── 7-edges.py
│   ├── 8-concat_edges.py
│   └── 9-easter_egg.py
└── README.md
```

## Tasks

The project consists of the following tasks:

1. Hello, print: A Python script that prints the message "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle" followed by a new line.

2. Print integer: A Python script that prints the integer stored in the variable `number`, followed by the string "Battery street" and a new line.

3. Print float: A Python script that prints the float stored in the variable `number` with a precision of 2 digits.

4. Print string: A Python script that prints the string stored in the variable `str` three times, followed by the first 9 characters of the string.

5. Play with strings: A Python script that prints the sentence "Welcome to Holberton School!" using only the provided variables `str1` and `str2`.

6. Copy - Cut - Paste: A Python script that manipulates the variable `word` to extract the first 3 letters, the last 2 letters, and the middle part of the word.

7. Create a new sentence: A Python script that concatenates specific parts of the given strings to create the sentence "object-oriented programming with Python".

8. Easter Egg: A Python script that prints "The Zen of Python" by Tim Peters, which is a collection of guiding principles for writing Python code.

## Usage

To run any of the Python scripts, navigate to the corresponding task directory and execute the script using the Python interpreter. For example:

```
python3 0x00/2-print.py
```

## Code Style

The code in this repository follows the official Python coding style outlined in PEP8. To check the code against the style guide, you can use the `pycodestyle` tool with the following command:

```
pycodestyle <filename>
```
