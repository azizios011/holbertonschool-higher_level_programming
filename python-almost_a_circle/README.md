## Introduction

The "Almost a Circle" project provides a Python module that allows you to work with circles and perform various operations on them. The module includes classes for creating Circle objects and functions for calculating properties and performing operations on these circles.

The main features of the module include:

- Creation of Circle objects with a given radius or diameter.
- Calculation of the area and circumference of a circle.
- Comparison of circles based on their areas and circumferences.
- Overlapping and containment checks between circles.
- Serialization and deserialization of circle objects to and from JSON.

The project is implemented in Python and can be easily integrated into your own Python projects.

## Installation

To use the "Almost a Circle" module in your Python project, you can follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
2. Clone the project repository from GitHub:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/almost-a-circle.git
   ```

   Alternatively, you can download the source code as a ZIP file from the repository page and extract it to a local directory.

3. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```shell
   cd almost-a-circle
   ```

4. Install the required dependencies using pip:

   ```shell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. Now you can import the `circle` module in your Python script:

   ```python
   from circle import Circle
   ```

## Usage

The "Almost a Circle" module provides a `Circle` class that represents a circle. You can create a new circle object by specifying its radius or diameter. Here's an example:

```python
from circle import Circle

# Create a circle with radius 5
circle1 = Circle(radius=5)

# Create a circle with diameter 10
circle2 = Circle(diameter=10)
```

Once you have a circle object, you can perform various operations on it or retrieve its properties. For example:

```python
# Calculate the area of the circle
area = circle1.area()

# Calculate the circumference of the circle
circumference = circle2.circumference()

# Compare circles based on their areas
is_circle1_larger = circle1 > circle2

# Check if two circles overlap
overlap = circle1.overlaps(circle2)

# Check if a circle contains another circle
contains = circle1.contains(circle2)
```

For more detailed information about the available methods and attributes of the `Circle` class, please refer to the source code documentation.

## Examples

To help you get started, the "Almost a Circle" project provides a set of examples in the `examples` directory. Each example demonstrates the usage of different features and functionalities of the module. You can run these examples to see the module in action.

To run an example, navigate to the `examples` directory and execute the corresponding Python script. For example:

```shell
cd examples
python example1.py
```

Feel free to explore the examples and modify them according to your needs.
