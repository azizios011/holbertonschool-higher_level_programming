## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/python-io.git`
2. Change into the project directory: `cd python-io`
3. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

Once the project is set up, you can run the Python scripts directly from the command line. The available scripts are:

- `input_demo.py`: Demonstrates various techniques for reading user input.
- `output_demo.py`: Shows different methods for writing output to the console and files.

To run a script, use the following command: `python script_name.py`

## Features

This project includes the following features:

- Reading user input from the console.
- Validating and processing input data.
- Writing output to the console.
- Saving output to files.

## Examples

### Reading User Input

To read user input, you can use the `input()` function in Python. Here's an example:

```python
name = input("Enter your name: ")
print("Hello, " + name + "! Welcome to the Python - Input/Output project.")
```

### Writing Output

To write output to the console, you can use the `print()` function. Here's an example:

```python
print("This is an example of console output.")
```

To save output to a file, you can open a file in write mode and use the `write()` method. Here's an example:

```python
with open("output.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write("This is an example of file output.")
```
