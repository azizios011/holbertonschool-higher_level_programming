## Introduction

In Python, classes are used to define objects that have both attributes (variables) and methods (functions). This project focuses on exploring more advanced concepts related to classes, such as class attributes, instance methods, and special methods.

## Class Attributes

Class attributes are variables that are shared by all instances of a class. They are defined within the class but outside of any methods. All instances of the class can access and modify these attributes. Examples of class attributes include constants or default values shared among instances.

## Instance Methods

Instance methods are functions defined within a class and operate on instances of that class. These methods have access to the instance's attributes and can modify them as needed. Instance methods are used to perform actions or provide functionality specific to each instance of the class.

## Special Methods

Special methods, also known as magic methods or dunder methods, are prefixed and suffixed with double underscores (e.g., `__init__`, `__str__`, `__repr__`). These methods provide special functionalities to the class instances. They are automatically invoked in specific situations, such as object initialization, string representation, comparison, and deletion.

## Usage Examples

The project provides several usage examples that demonstrate the concepts discussed:

- Understanding the `__init__` method for object initialization.
- Utilizing the `__str__` and `__repr__` methods for string representation of instances.
- Exploring the `__del__` method for performing actions during object deletion.
- Accessing the `__doc__` attribute to retrieve the documentation of an object.
